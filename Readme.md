# Hacklab Ghana Developer Census 2020

## Published by Hacklab Research

### Overview

Hacklab Ghana Developer Census 2020 is the first and most comprehensive survey of people who code in Ghana. In 2020, Hacklab Research fielded a survey covering everything from developers’ favorite technologies to their job preferences. This marks the first of annual surveys to be published. This maiden edition witnessed the participation of 272 developers who took the 20-minute survey earlier between November - December 2020

Despite our survey’s reach and capacity for informing valuable conclusions, we acknowledge that our results don’t represent everyone in the Ghana developer community evenly. We have further work to do to make the Hacklab Ghana Developer Census 2020 a more inclusive, diverse platform, and a reflection in the community at large.

We're very excited to see what you'll do with the data. We encourage you to [share any insights, projects or models](mailto://bawah@hacklabfoundation.org) you generate with this data with us.
